# ml-spam-filter
In this project, I create a classifier to distinguish spam emails from normal ones. Specifically, I use supervised learning to classify each email as such. Overall, it attains 99.4% accuracy on a set of 1000 test emails. 

It uses Python, including SciKit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy and more. Of course, these dependencies don't mater since you can simply open up the notebook file and see the output!

#### How to use
To view this project, simply open up spam_ml_filter.ipynb where you can see output. You can also clone the repo and make whatever edits you want using jupyter or Google Collaboratory
